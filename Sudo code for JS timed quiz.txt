Sudo for Javascript timed quiz

When I click on the page I am presented with a title card and instructions on how to play above a 'start' button
when I click 'start' I start a quiz containing 10 randomly selected questions from a list of 20 or so and clock of 60 seconds begins to count down
These questions will have 4 choices for answers 1 is correct and the other 3 are assinged to the question in question
if answered corrently the question will change and a seperate title will appear confriming the selection was correct! answer will be logged as true
if answered false the question will change and a seperate title will appear confriming the selection was wrong answer will be logged as false
Also if answered false the clock will loose 5 seconds
if all questions are answered or time runs to 0 the game will end and give the player their score based off the time remaining 
player is able to enter their initals and 'save' score into local or 'discard time' 
if 'save' is pressed link player to scoreboard
if 'discard time' is pressed link player back to home screen
at scoreboard two buttons will be present one will say 'return to start' and once will say 'clear'
if 'return to start' is pressed link player back to home screen
if 'clear' is pressed all data stored on scoreboard is deleted
The scoreboard should show all attemps made with initals and score and score should be decending from top-down
