# Homework Week 3
## Javascript-Timed-Quiz

### User Story
```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
### Work Description
I started by writing out sudo code on a blank notepad document to help me understand the path I wanted to take to complete the task. After looking into JS prompt parameters I started to write the JS code to make the application useable.

With the use of if, else if and else statements I was able to create a work path that asked the user for the password parameters and logged the data. After a lot of reading into Math functions and looking at 'random generation properties' found within JS, I was able to create a working random character generator that would use the desired inputs. Along the way I added in warnings if the inputs were invalid or not completed.

With minimal de-bugging I was able to create a fully functioning password generator that achieves all acceptance criteria required.
